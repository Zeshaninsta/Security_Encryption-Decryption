# Encrytion and Decrytion Full Stack web App Using React and Flask

# ETE CipherCraft

ETE CipherCraft is a project developed by Emran, Tuji, and Eebisa, three dedicated students from Madda Walabu University's Information Technology Department. The project was initiated as part of their coursework under the guidance of Mr. Tagegn, their Information Assurance and Security teacher.

## Project Overview

The ETE CipherCraft project focuses on implementing encryption and decryption techniques using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The primary encryption methods employed in this project are the Caesar Cipher and a Custom Cipher developed by the team.

## Installation

### Frontend (React)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Zeshaninsta/Security_Encryption-Decryption.git
   cd Security_Encryption-Decryption/frontend
   ```
   # 1 Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   # 2 Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend (Flask):

1.  Go to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/Zeshaninsta/Security_Encryption-Decryption.git
    cd Security_Encryption-Decryption/backend

    ```

    ### 1 Install Flask

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

    ### 2 Run Flask Server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    # Encryption Methods

    ```bash
    Caesar Cipher
    Custom Cipher

    ```

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. It operates using a key, representing the number of positions each letter is shifted.
Example:

    Plain: HELLO
    Key: 3
    Encrypted: KHOOR

## Custom Cipher

The Custom Cipher involves two keys, the first being the standard alphabet, and the second being the reverse of the alphabet. Encryption and decryption are based on aligning each letter with the corresponding letter in the custom encryption key.

## Project Aim

The aim of the ETE CipherCraft project is to provide a practical implementation of encryption and decryption techniques, enabling users to understand and apply fundamental cryptographic concepts. The project emphasizes hands-on learning and the exploration of both classic and custom encryption methods.
